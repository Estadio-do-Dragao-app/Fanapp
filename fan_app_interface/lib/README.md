Project `lib/` structure overview

This README summarizes the feature-first / clean-architecture layout used in
this project. Each feature contains `data/`, `domain/` and `presentation/`.

Top-level `core/` contains shared utilities used across features.

The map feature is the app's primary feature and has been created with
comment-only placeholders; the other features below are created as directory
placeholders with guidance files so you can implement them incrementally.
