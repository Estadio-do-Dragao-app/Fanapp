Global errors and exceptions

This directory should contain domain-agnostic error types, custom exceptions and
helpers to map low-level errors (network, database) to user-friendly
representations.

Examples:
- `app_exception.dart` - base exception types
- `failure.dart` - Failure classes used by repositories/usecases
