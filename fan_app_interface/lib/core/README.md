Core utilities and shared components for the app.

This directory should contain:
- constants/: application-wide constants (strings, keys, API endpoints)
- errors/: global error and exception types
- helpers/: small pure functions and utilities
- widgets/: reusable UI widgets (buttons, cards, chips)
- theme/: app ThemeData and color definitions
- services/: global services (location, notifications, analytics)

Placeholders in this directory are lightweight and should avoid implementation code.
